# Phishing-Email-Analyzer
# Phishing Email Analyzer (AI-Powered)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The Phishing Email Analyzer is a prototype cybersecurity tool that uses AI to detect potential phishing attempts in emails.  
Users can paste the content of an email, and the tool provides:
- A phishing **risk score (0â€“100%)**  
- **Color-coded alerts** (green = safe, yellow = suspicious, red = dangerous)  
- An **explanation** of what indicators were found  

This project was developed as part of my CIS Capstone and is designed to deliver **business value** while demonstrating technical and AI skills.
