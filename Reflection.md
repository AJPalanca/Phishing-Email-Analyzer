# Reflection – Phishing Email Analyzer

## 1. AI Brainstorming Summary
I asked AI to generate one-week CIS capstone project ideas and picked the Phishing Email Analyzer because it:
- Is realistic to build in one week
- Demonstrates cybersecurity and AI skills
- Delivers clear business value

AI suggested multiple ideas and helped refine the project scope.

## 2. Why I Chose This Artifact
Phishing is a real-world threat. An AI-powered analyzer shows practical impact and is portfolio-worthy for cybersecurity roles.

## 3. What Worked
- AI helped me quickly choose a feasible, valuable project.
- Scoping to an MVP (minimal viable product) made one-week completion realistic.
- Using placeholder files lets me show repository structure immediately.

## 4. What Didn’t Work
- AI can suggest overly ambitious features; I had to narrow scope.
- Early tests showed AI explanations can be verbose and need formatting.

## 5. Lessons Learned About Using AI
- AI speeds up brainstorming and documentation.
- Prompts must be precise to get useful analysis output.
- Keep sensitive API keys out of GitHub; use environment files locally.

## 6. Next Steps
- Implement the frontend form and backend AI calls.
- Populate `sample_emails.json` with more test cases.
- Run rubric-based self-evaluation and document results.
